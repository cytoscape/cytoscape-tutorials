    <h1>Basic Expression Analysis</h1>
    <p><highlight>Cytoscape is an open source software platform for integrating, visualizing, and analyzing measurement data in the context of networks.</highlight></p>

    <p>This tutorial presents a scenario of how expression and network data can be combined to tell a biological story and includes these concepts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visualizing networks using expression data.</li>
            <li>Filtering networks based on expression data.</li>
            <li>Assessing expression data in the context of a biological network.</li>
        </ul>

		<h3>Visualizing Expression Data on Networks</h3>
		<p>Probably the most common use of expression data in Cytoscape is to set the visual properties of the nodes in a network according to expression data. This creates a powerful visualization, portraying functional relation and experimental response at the same time. Here, we will show an example of doing this.</p>
		<p>The data used in this example is from yeast, and the genes <b>Gal1</b>, <b>Gal4</b>, and <b>Gal80</b> are all yeast transcription factors. The experiments all involve some perturbation of these transcription factor genes.

		<br /><br />Gal1, Gal4, and Gal80 are also represented in the interaction network, where they are labeled according to yeast locus tags: <b>Gal1 corresponds to YBR020W, Gal4 to YPL248C, and Gal80 to YML051W</b>.</p>

		<p>In this demo file, the  following node attributes have been mapped to visual style properties:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The "gal80exp" expression values are used for <b>Node Fill Color</b>.</li>
			<li>The <b>Default Node Color</b>, for nodes with no data mapping, is dark grey.</li>
			<li>Nodes with expression values that are significant are rendered as rectangles, others are ovals.</li>
			<li>The common name for each gene is used as the <b>Node Label</b>.</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>The experimental data is visible in the Node Table:</li><br />

			<img plain src="modules/loading-omics-data/Galbrowse3.png" style="width:80%"><br /><br />

	<h3>Observe the Network</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Notice that three dark red (highly induced) nodes are in the same region of the graph.</li>
		<li>Notice that there are two nodes that interact with all three red nodes: GAL4 (YPL248C) and GAL11 (YOL051W).</li>

		<div class="cybrowser">

			<ul>
				<li>First select GAL4 (YPL248C) by clicking on it.</li>
				<li>Now, extend the selection by holding down the shift key and clicking on GAL11 (YOL051W).</li>
				<li>Finally, select their neighbors by control-6 (or &#8984;-6 on a Mac), or by the menu <highlight>Select &rarr; Nodes &rarr; First Neighbors of Selected Nodes &rarr; Undirected</highligh></li>

	<p>Digging into the biology of this network, it turns out that GAL4 is repressed by GAL80. Both nodes (GAL4 and GAL11) show fairly small changes in expression, and neither change is statistically significant: they are rendered as light-colored circles. These slight changes in expression suggest that the critical change affecting the red nodes might be somewhere else in the network, and not either of these nodes.
	GAL4 interacts with GAL80 (YML051W), which shows a significant level of repression: it is depicted as a blue rectangle.
	<p>Note that while GAL80 shows evidence of significant repression, most nodes interacting with GAL4 show significant levels of induction: they are rendered as red rectangles.
	GAL11 is a general transcription co-factor with many interactions.</p>
	<p>Putting all of this together, we see that the transcriptional activation activity of Gal4 is repressed by Gal80. So, repression of Gal80 increases the transcriptional activation activity of Gal4. Even though the expression of Gal4 itself did not change much, the Gal4 transcripts were much more likely to be active transcription factors when Gal80 was repressed. This explains why there is so much up-regulation in the vicinity of Gal4.</p>

	<h3>Exploring Nodes</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Right-click on the node GAL4.</li>
		<li>Select the menu <b>External Links → Sequences and Proteins → Entrez Gene</b>.</li>
		<li>This action will pop-up a browser window and search the Entrez Gene database for the term "YPL248C", the id of the node.</li>
		<li>In the results in the browser the first entry should be labeled GAL4. Click on this entry.</li>
		<li>The description of GAL4 tells us that it is repressed by GAL80.</li>

	<p>Our data show precisely this:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Both nodes (GAL4 and GAL11) show fairly small changes in expression, and neither change is statistically significant: they are rendered as light-colored circles. These slight changes in expression suggest that the critical change affecting the black nodes might be somewhere else in the network, and not either of these nodes.</li>
		<li>GAL4 interacts with GAL80 (YML051W), which shows a significant level of repression: it is depicted as a red square.</li>
		<li>Note that while GAL80 shows evidence of significant repression, most nodes interacting with GAL4 show significant levels of induction: they are rendered as green squares.</li>
		<li>GAL11 is a general transcription co-factor with many interactions.</li>
